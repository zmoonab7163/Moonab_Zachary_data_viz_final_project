            <abstract>The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD1:24K) statewide download of March 17th 2015, includes all surface waters in the state. Only a collection of named lakes or reservoirs extracted from the NHD are used in this layer.  Please reference metadata for contact information.  </abstract>

                <procdesc>GNIS Lake Points were used as reference points to find the lakes. The GNIS points were then checked against the 1995 Digital Ortho Quadrangles (DOQs). The points were then moved if necessary to represent the center of the lakes, or the point most likely to remain water during drought. Other points were added to represent lakes that did not have GNIS points. The names of the points were then checked against the Digital Raster Graphics and other resources. The USGS Hydrography layer was then clipped to the point coverage, so that there was a layer of just the polygons that intersected the points. The polygon coverage was then cleaned up to match the 1995 DOQs and given the appropriate name from the point coverage. The lakes that did not have names were sent to the respective Water Management District lake biologists for QA/QC. Additional QA/QC included the following: A LINK field was developed to ensure point + polygon correspondence 373 Duplicate Names were investigated 252 names had blank spaces before the Name that had to be removed County Names were compared to DEP Standards Unnecessary fields were removed</procdesc>

        <overview>
            <eaover>The National Hydrography Dataset is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of water, paths through which water flows, and related entities.  The information encoded about features includes a feature date, classification by type, other characteristics, a unique common identifier, the feature length or area, and (rarely) elevation of the surface of water pools and a description of the stage of the elevation.  For reaches, encoded information includes a reach code.  Names and their identifiers in the Geographic Names Information System, are assigned to most feature types.  The direction of flow is encoded for networked features.  The data also contains relations that encode metadata, and information that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data.  The names and  definitions of all feature types, characteristics, and values are in the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset:  Reston, Virginia, U.S. Geological Survey, 1999.  The document is available online through http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/.</eaover>
